The tasks state is initialized as an empty array and each task is an object with id, title, and completed properties. addTask accepts a title parameter, creates a new task with a unique id (Date.now() for simplicity), sets the completed status to false, and updates the tasks array using the spread operator.

Toggling Task Completion takes a task's id, iterates through the tasks array, finds the task with the matching id, and toggles the completed status. The state is updated immutably by returning a new array.

The tasks are displayed using .map() to render each taskâ€™s title and completion status, which is displayed as Completed or Incomplete based on the completed status. Each task has a "Toggle Completion" button that toggles the task's completion status by calling toggleTaskCompletion when clicked,.
